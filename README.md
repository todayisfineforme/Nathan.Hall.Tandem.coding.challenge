## Description
 A trivia training app built for the Tandem for 400 Coding Challenge. it generates a 10 question round from a predetermined list supplied at the beginning of the challenge. question order is shuffled as well as answer order within those questions.

## Challenge Assumptions
- A round of trivia has 10 Questions
- All questions are multiple-choice questions
- Your score does not need to update in real time
- Results can update on form submit, button click, or any interaction you choose
- We(Tandem) will provide you with the trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers via a JSON file.

## Challenge Acceptance Criteria
- A user can view questions.
- Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time.
- Questions should not repeat in a round.
- A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers.
- The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer
- A user can see the score they received at the end of the round

## Prerequisites

- npm >=5.5.0
- node >=9.3.0

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm start 
```
## Future plans
- add a simple backend that stores high scores so that users company wide could compare their scores. 
- adding a larger bank of questions, as well as the ability to have multiple rounds.
- add the ability to have a round that has you answer as many questions as you can in a fixed period of time.
- possibly add a "party play" feature that has multiple users in the same instance all competing against one another
